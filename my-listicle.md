4. Sweet Lightning
> This Mt. Dew flavor is sure to *spark* interest. Like other flavors, it has a signiture fruity taste, BUT it is unique and unlike any other... Rather than a citrus drink, Sweet Lighting is peach and honey flavor! Sure to pair perfectly with that nice batch of KFC chicken it is exclusively sold with.

5. Infinite Swirl
> At 7-11 and Speedway exclusively, this *swirl* of pineapple and berry falvors sure makes for a great taste!
